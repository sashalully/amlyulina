# Steller's sea cow

### Description

Steller's sea cows grew to be 8 to 9 m (26 to 30 ft) long as adults, much larger than extant sirenians.[6] Georg Steller's writings contain two contradictory estimates of weight: 4 and 24.3 metric tons (4.4 and 26.8 short tons). The true value is estimated to fall between these figures, at about 8–10 metric tons (8.8–11.0 short tons).[7] This size made the sea cow one of the largest mammals of the Holocene epoch, aside from whales.[8]

### Ecology and behavior

Whether Steller's sea cow had any natural predators is unknown. It may have been hunted by killer whales and sharks, though its buoyancy may have made it difficult for killer whales to drown, and the rocky kelp forests in which the sea cow lived may have deterred sharks. According to Steller, the adults guarded the young from predators.[6]

Steller described an ectoparasite on the sea cows that was similar to the whale louse (Cyamus ovalis), but the parasite remains unidentified due to the host's extinction and loss of all original specimens collected by Steller.[15] It was first formally described as Sirenocyamus rhytinae in 1846 by Johann Friedrich von Brandt. It was the only species of cyamid amphipod to be reported inhabiting a sirenian.[16] Steller also identified an endoparasite on the sea cows, which was likely an ascarid nematode.[12]

### Taxonomy

Steller's sea cow was a member of the genus Hydrodamalis, a group of large sirenians, whose sister taxon was Dusisiren. Like those of Steller's sea cow, the ancestors of Dusisiren lived in tropical mangroves before adapting to the cold climates of the North Pacific.[20] Hydrodamalis and Dusisiren are classified together in the subfamily Hydrodamalinae,[21] which diverged from other sirenians around 4 to 8 mya.[22] Steller's sea cow is a member of the family Dugongidae, whose sole surviving member, and thus Steller's sea cow's closest living relative, is the dugong (Dugong dugon).[23]
